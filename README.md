Human-readable aliases for MySQL versions.

node
----

* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['log_level']` - Log level for
the service node daemon. Defaults to `info`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['index']` - Unique instance
info; should be configured to be different between nodes. Defaults to `0`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['capacity']` - Maximum number
of service instances for this node. Defaults to `200`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['port_range']['first']` -
The lower end of a range of ports that can be used for services nodes.
Defaults to `25001`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['port_range']['last']` -
The higher end of a range of ports that can be used for services nodes.
Defaults to `45000`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['migration_nfs']` - Path to
a directory that will be used when dumping and reimporting a node. Defaults
to `/mnt/migration`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['op_time_limit']` - Maximum
time to wait during provisioning. Defaults to `6`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['versions']` - A Hash mapping
versions of MySQL to their runtime details. Defaults to `{}`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['default_version']` - The
default version for requests to this node. Defaults to `2.2`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['ip_route']` - The IP address
of a host that will be used to determine the correct IP address to use to
talk to other components; or `nil` to use the default. Defaults to `nil`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['z_interval']` - Frequency
in seconds between updating and announcing "varz" (i.e. service status
information). Defaults to `30`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['max_nats_payload']` - Maximum
size in bytes of a single announcement; bigger ones will be split into
multiple messages. Defaults to `1048576`.
* `node['cloudfoundry_mysql_service']['node']['fqdn_hosts']` - If true,
service bindings credentials will be issued using the hostname. If false,
the IP address will be used instead.. Defaults to `false`.

Usage
=====

You need exactly one MySQL service gateway, ideally deployed to the same
node as the `cloud_controller`:

    run_list: "recipe[cloudfoundry-mysql-service::gateway]"

You can run as many MySQL service nodes as needed to support your expected
work load:

    run_list: "recipe[cloudfoundry-mysql-service::node]"

You also need to install the MySQL package itself. You may want to provide
your own binaries, or you can use the simplified recipe in this cookbook:

    run_list: "recipe[cloudfoundry-mysql-service::install22]",
              "recipe[cloudfoundry-mysql-service::node]"
